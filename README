This is an example of a basic Spring Boot RESTful web service.

It contains all of the exception handling, OAuth authentication, JPA and other methodologies to 
create web services.

To build a WAR for this service, right click the application, Run As/Maven Install.  In the projects /target folder you will
find the war file.  This can be deployed to any Tomcat server.
