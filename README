This is an example of a basic Spring Boot RESTful web service.

It contains all of the exception handling, OAuth authentication, JPA and other methodologies the SOA Team will use to 
create web services.

To build a WAR for this service, right click the application, Run As/Maven Install.  In the projects /target folder you will
find the war file.  This can be deployed to any Tomcat server.

PLEASE NOTE:
This service uses the OAuthFilter dependency to perform authentication of the user.  It expects the AuthToken and AuthUserID request
parameters to be present for every request.  

If you wish to test locally and do not want to test the OAuthFilter, simply comment out the OAuthFilter dependency in
your pom.xml file as well as any code that checks the "allowed_roles" session attribute.

If you run the app as a Spring Boot App, the url is http://localhost:8080/bcpstatus

If you run the app on a Tomcat instance, the url is http://localhost:8080/BasicWebService/bcpstatus
